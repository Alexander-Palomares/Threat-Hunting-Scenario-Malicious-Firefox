# Threat Hunting Scenario â€“ Firefox Portable Abuse

## Overview

**Threat Name:** Unauthorized Use of Portable Firefox with Suspicious Download Activity  
**Objective:** Identify the use of Firefox Portable to bypass monitoring tools and transfer data using cloud-based services.

> ðŸš¨ **Reason for the Hunt:**  
A cybersecurity news alert detailed a rise in employees using portable browsers to bypass network monitoring and content filtering. Internal logs also flagged abnormal download behavior on a few endpoints. Management requested an internal threat hunt to detect unauthorized usage and assess risk exposure.

## Simulation Steps (What the "Bad Actor" Did)

1. Downloaded Firefox Portable from:  
   `https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable`

2. Extracted the package to a custom folder:  
   `C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\ff-portable`

3. Launched the browser:  
   `firefoxportable.exe`

4. Visited cloud services and uploaded/downloaded files:  
   - `mega.nz`  
   - `dropbox.com`  
   - `wetransfer.com`

5. Created a text file:  
   `private-notes.txt` â€” containing sensitive notes or info

6. Later deleted the file to hide activity

## Detection Tables (Microsoft Defender XDR)

| Table Name           | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DeviceFileEvents`   | Detects creation/deletion of files like `firefoxportable.exe`, `*.txt`, etc.|
| `DeviceProcessEvents`| Detects execution of processes like `firefoxportable.exe` from odd paths     |
| `DeviceNetworkEvents`| Identifies access to external cloud services from Firefox Portable           |

## KQL Queries

### 1. Detect Firefox Portable Placed on Disk
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName has "firefoxportable"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FolderPath, FileName, ActionType, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```

### 2. Detect Firefox Portable Execution
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName == "firefoxportable.exe"
| where FolderPath !contains "Program Files"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, FolderPath, ProcessCommandLine
```

### 3. Detect Network Access to Cloud Services
```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName == "firefoxportable.exe"
| where RemoteUrl has_any ("mega.nz", "wetransfer.com", "dropbox.com", "gofile.io")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessAccountName
```

### 4. Detect Sensitive File Creation or Deletion
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName in~ ("private-notes.txt", "project-docs.zip")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, ActionType, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```

## Additional Notes:
- This scenario can be executed in a lab using a Windows VM with Defender Sensor enabled (or simulated logs).
- Replace actual cloud service traffic with internal test domains if needed.
