# Threat Hunt Scenario: Malicious Firefox Extension

## Threat Event: Suspicious Firefox Extension Installation and Data Exfiltration

### Reason for Hunt
Unusual network traffic patterns were detected by the SOC, specifically encrypted outbound traffic to unknown external domains during non-business hours. Multiple alerts referenced `firefox.exe` as the initiating process. A recent cybersecurity news article also highlighted malicious extensions affecting Firefox browsers with capabilities for credential theft and surveillance.

## Steps the "Bad Actor" Took to Create Logs and IoCs

1. User receives a phishing email encouraging them to install a "Productivity Boost" Firefox extension from a non-Mozilla domain.
2. Victim opens Firefox and manually installs the `.xpi` extension file.
3. Extension runs in the background, logging keystrokes and capturing form data (e.g., credentials).
4. Extension establishes C2 (Command and Control) communication with a remote server via HTTPS.
5. Periodic exfiltration of stolen data (logins, cookies) to the attackerâ€™s server.
6. Attacker uses stolen credentials to attempt unauthorized logins into internal systems.
7. User closes and reopens Firefox over several days as the extension remains persistent.

## Tables Used to Detect IoCs

| **Table Name**         | **Description**                                                                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DeviceProcessEvents`  | Detects Firefox process launch and execution context for identifying suspicious launches.                   |
| `DeviceFileEvents`     | Detects installation of `.xpi` files, which are Firefox extension files.                                     |
| `DeviceNetworkEvents`  | Tracks network traffic initiated by Firefox, including suspicious external connections.                      |
